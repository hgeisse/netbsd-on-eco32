Welcome to NetBSD-on-ECO32!

This little project offers the possibility to run NetBSD on the
ECO32 system, which is a system-on-chip (written in synthesizable
Verilog), together with a simulator, so that one can experiment
without the need to have an FPGA board available. NetBSD is placed
onto a disk partition of a simulated disk and can be bootstrapped
from there.

NOTE 1: The NetBSD system itself (kernel and userland programs) is
merely used by this project. A small crew is developing the system
actively in his project:

Hint: If you want to inspect or download the code, please use
branch "testing" (.../hellwig/netbsd-eco32/tree/testing), as this
is the place where interesting things happen. If you intend to
download the project, please contact one of the maintainers;
our version of GitLab is not able to format a compressed file
properly - sorry for that.

NOTE 2: It is absolutely necessary to first download and build
the ECO32 project, which is available on the OpenCores platform:

        http://opencores.org/project,eco32

NOTE 3: In order to utilize the various tools from the ECO32
project, you will be asked to supply a path to the "build"
directory of the ECO32 project. The path depends on your local
installation, but usually ends in .../eco32/trunk/build.

If you have any questions (or are eager to contribute to this
project), don't hesitate to contact the ECO32 team by email to

        Hellwig.Geisse@mni.thm.de

Enjoy!
