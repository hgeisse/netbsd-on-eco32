Welcome to NetBSD-on-ECO32!

This little project offers the possibility to run NetBSD on the
ECO32 system, which is a system-on-chip (written in synthesizable
Verilog), together with a simulator, so that one can experiment
without the need to have an FPGA board available. NetBSD is placed
onto a disk partition of a simulated disk and can be bootstrapped
from there.

NOTE 1: The NetBSD system itself (kernel and userland programs) is
merely used by this project. A small crew is actively developing
the system in this project:

        http://vshg02.mni.thm.de/hellwig/netbsd-eco32

There's no need to download this project; all necessary binaries
are included here.

NOTE 2: It is absolutely necessary to first download and build
the ECO32 project, which is also available here on GitHub:

        http://github.com/hgeisse/eco32

NOTE 3: After building ECO32 you can build NetBSD-on-ECO32. In
order to utilize the various tools from the ECO32 project, you
will be asked to supply a path to the "build" directory of the
ECO32 project. The path depends on your local installation, but
usually ends in .../eco32/build.

NOTE 4: After building NetBSD-on-ECO32, go back to the ECO32
tree. In .../eco32/build/run you can build a disk and run the
simulator as usual (make run-sim). The disk will be populated
with a NetBSD partition.

If you have any questions (or are eager to contribute to this
project), don't hesitate to contact the ECO32 team by email to

        Hellwig.Geisse@mni.thm.de

Enjoy!
